Colloquy (<http://colloquy.info>) is a very nice IRC application for Mac OS X, but its included chat styles are in need of some serious design and usability work. Succinct is an add-on style that is designed to be the "missing style" for Colloquy and is inspired by 37signals's Campfire design, but re-purposed for IRC communication.


Four reasons to love "Succinct" for Colloquy
--------------------------------------------

1. Simple clean design.
2. Emphasizes what you need.
3. De-emphasizes what you donâ€™t.
4. Customize what you hate.

Installation
------------

1. After you have downloaded and installed Colloquy, download the latest version of Succinct from the "tags" pages on GitHub:
   https://github.com/JohnAlbin/succinct-for-colloquy/tags

2. Double-click the succinct-for-colloquy-2.0.zip file. Open the newly created succinct-for-colloquy-2.0 folder and double-click the Succinct.colloquyStyle file to install the style.

3. Start or re-start Colloquy. (Typing "/reload style" in a Colloquy chat window may work, but is inconsistently buggy.)

4. To change the style of one chatroom/channel, select the "Succinct" option from the Style drop-down menu. Or, to set Succinct as your default Colloquy chat style, choose the "Appearance Preferences..." option from the Style drop-down menu. (Where you can can also choose to customize the colors via the "Customize Style..." button.)
