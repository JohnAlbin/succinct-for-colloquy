Colloquy (<http://colloquy.info>) is a very nice IRC client for Mac OS X. It does, however, need some help in the area of useful chat styles.


Four reasons to love “Succinct” for Colloquy
--------------------------------------------

1. Simple clean design.
2. Emphasizes what you you need.
3. De-emphasizes what you don’t.
4. Customize what you hate.

Installation
------------

1. Copy the file Succinct.colloquyStyle file to this folder in your home folder:
     Library -> Application Support -> Colloquy -> Styles

2. Start or re-start Colloquy. (Typing "/reload style" in a Colloquy chat window may work, but is buggy.)

3. Select the “Succinct” option from the Style drop-down.

4. Choose the “Appearance Preferences…” to set Succinct as your default Colloquy chat style or to customize the colors via its “Customize Style…” button.
