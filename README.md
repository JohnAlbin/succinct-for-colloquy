Colloquy (<http://colloquy.info>) is a very nice IRC application for Mac OS X,
but its included chat styles are in need of some serious design and usability
work. Succinct is an add-on style that is designed to be the "missing style" for
Colloquy and is inspired by 37signals's Campfire design, but re-purposed for IRC
communication.


Four reasons to love "Succinct" for Colloquy
--------------------------------------------

1. Simple clean design.
2. Emphasizes what you need.
3. De-emphasizes what you donâ€™t.
4. Customize what you hate.

4. Copy the file Succinct.colloquyStyle file from Step 2 to the Styles folder
   from Step 3.
